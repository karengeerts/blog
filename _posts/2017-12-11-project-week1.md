During the boot camp, I'll be working on a total of 4 projects. Since we only have 12 weeks, this means that every third week will be project week. So this week we will start working on our first project, which will give me a chance to put all I've learned in the last 2 weeks into practice.

The first week was mainly focused on JavaScript, with its data types, control flows and functions - which we expanded on in week 2. In the second week CSS3 and HTML5 were also added to the mix. I enjoy playing around with the functionality many times more than spending time making the output look pretty, but I know it's a necessary evil. And if I do make an effort and spend some time with my CSS, I actually am quite pleased with myself. One of the more fun exercises I played around with was creating an online bank (with very limited functionality). You can take a look at the end result <a href="https://karengeerts.github.io/onlinebank/">here</a>.

Frustration reared its ugly head as well during the second week - for some reason I seem to think it's even more stupid to make spelling mistakes with my variables than just apply the completely wrong logic to the solution. But having to add a ) after a } after spending what feels like hours feels so little heroic. Not sure what a heroic mistake would look like to be honest - I'll let you know once I find out!
