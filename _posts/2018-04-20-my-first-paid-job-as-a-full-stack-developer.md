The last 4 days I have been in paid employment with a company called <a href="https://www.3sixty1.com.au/">3sixty1</a> - I got a phone call last week Friday afternoon asking if I could start on Monday! They had to develop a website they could demo to a customer, and did not have the capability within their own team.

So another graduate from the General Assembly bootcamp arrived in their South Melbourne office on Monday to quickly set up a functional CRM using Ruby on Rails and a simple HTML frontend. Well I say simple, but since the prototype pages were designed using Dreamweaver, we had to deal with some funky HTML code.

I really enjoyed the experience, it was challenging at the right level and we received support where we needed (especially from the UI specialist, but unfortunately with only 2 hours left to finish the code). It felt really good to know I'm capable of delivering a more than half decent end product in just 4 days.

I can't share the actual code, but can say that the website has logon functionality, user administration, added functionalities and views when you're logged on as an admin type person, views of the database (including filtering on types of customer and searching for customer names), detailed views of contacts, the possibility to update a contact details, functionality that allows you to upload a csv file that gets extracted into the database, and links to reports created in Tableau.

Having finished working with them, it's back to the big Job Search now. I am in contact with a few companies and I feel positive about the future, but it would be a lot nicer if I had the assurance of a job so I could actually enjoy this time of not having to work. Keep your fingers crossed for me!
