As so many people before me, I've failed to continue with the regular updates to my blog. But luckily I'm just in time to write a little retro of my first 4 months in my first developer role.

The good:
- I have learned heaps and heaps - even when I didn't realise I was actually learning and only felt super confused. I try to take as many notes as I can when someone explains a concept to me, or even while we're pairing - I like to have a read of the thought process we went through, how and where we were poking around with the code before coming to the right solution. Rereading these notes helps me heaps - I can now fill in the gaps of the notes of my early days, and I will continue with this approach until I can recognise the patterns and no longer need to write down what we're doing, because I will know what steps are required.

- I am in the super priviliged position of having 3 mentors at work (and also one at home), which is great, because they all look at things in slightly different ways, and offer me different advice. I realise there is no 1 right way of doing anything (although there are several wrong ways), so it's interesting to hear about the different approaches that are possible. I also believe 3 is enough; more would just add to the confusion.

- I have found my feet! There are lots of analogies I could use to describe the first few months, this time I'll go for being at the beach, standing in the sea and see the waves coming at you. Waves can be very big and frightening things if you've never seen one in your life, so you'd probably panic, try to keep yourself upright - and you'll feel the full force of the wave, swiping you of your feet and dragging you down. That's how I felt for a very long time (and I suspect I will continue to feel so in the future, but not Every Single Day). I have discovered it can be fun to dig around in a ginormous code base and try to discover how previous developers tried to outsmart the next generation using every single gem they could get their hands on.

- I currently have 1 day in the week that I can dedicate to study, and am trying to increase that number - or at least change that day to be a working from home day. Trying to get my head around the *Well Grounded Rubyist* requires a lot of focus, which is not easy to find and maintain in an open office environment.

The bad:
- 2 senior developers have left the team. While I'm happy for them, it leaves the rest of the team in an interesting situation, with a lack of senior devs to pair with on most days.

- there is no real structured approach within the company for graduates from bootcamps (although it is a work in progress and there's definitely a drive to improve the experience for recent graduates). This means that some people enjoy a close 1-on-1 mentoring relationship with someone who keeps tabs on their development, and others (like me) are left to finding their own way with very limited guidance. The day to day pairing works great, but I believe there is a limit to the amount of knowledge and skill that can be transferred through pairing on production code. 

The confusing stuff:
- I believe every new developer thinks their code base is a nightmare and they struggle to find their way around. I'm no different in that respect: our squad is owner for give or take 35 different systems, mainly microservices of which some are accessible to our internal customers via an API. I understand why this approach was taken, but I do sometimes wonder how it would be like to work in a team where they have just the 1 system.

- On top of the code base, there's also a lot of domain knowledge to learn, and concepts that have a very specific meaning in our tribe.

- The way our monitoring systems are set up. I'm trying to figure out why we're using system A for type 1 alerts for some of our applications, but for other applications we use systems B,C and D.

Wow, this post became a lot longer than I anticipated - I'll try to be a bit more concise in the future, without not sharing anything for 2 months.
