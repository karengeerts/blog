After a few extremely slow weeks in which not a lot happened on the job search front, I'm now invited by <strong>3 companies </strong>to interview with them in <strong>1 week</strong>, with the first series kicking off later today.

Today I have 2 interviews with the same company, tomorrow just the 1 with another and later this week 3 interviews with yet another company. I'm pretty confident I should at least get one job offer out of these, but if not, I'll have gained tonnes of experience in how to interview.

I prepared myself by looking at the code I submitted for the code challenges again and realising I had made mistakes in the code. So I created a new branch to make it really obvious I had made changes after submitting my solution, and fixed the issue. In my mind this shows a willingness to admit failure and an eagerness to improve - let's hope the interviewers share my view.

Another great resource I found is this <a href="https://github.com/yangshun/front-end-interview-handbook">Github repo</a> - while it is targeted towards front-end developers and I'm more interested in back-end roles, it's still an interesting resource with heaps of tips and tricks.

I've also reviewed my <a href="https://theinterviewguys.com/star-method/">STAR stories</a> - although it is a bit of a worry I don't have any developer flavoured stories to tell (yet). I also had a sneak peek on <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com.au/index.htm">Glassdoor</a> to see what the interview process looks like and how employees rate their company. However, I don't take what people have written there as gospel - every company has its disgruntled employees, nobody is perfect after all.

The final step of preparing for interviews is finding out as much as I can about the companies, by reaching out to people who work there or have worked there previously, reading what they say about themselves on their website and social media (including watching a lot of YouTube videos).

Having done all that, all I can do now is stay calm, stay confident and show how competent I am.
