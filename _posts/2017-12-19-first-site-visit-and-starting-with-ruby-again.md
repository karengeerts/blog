Last week's project turned out to be developing a tic tac toe game. I was one of the few who happily started coding away in JavaScript and left the UI until the end (which probably shows...).  You can take a look at the actual game <a href="https://karengeerts.github.io/project1/">here</a> and look at the code <a href="https://github.com/karengeerts/project1">here</a>. In the break in the next few weeks I'm planning on adding some extra functionality - ideally the option to request any size grid between 3 by 3 and 10 by 10, combined with the option to choose anything to be a winning sequence to keep things interesting (such as XOXOXOXO).

The presentations of other students were really interesting to see - some of them had limited functionality but looked absolutely amazing. Others had implemented lots of added functionality (options to play against the computer, change the game's theme, add some music, etc).

This week is the first week  we do Ruby - which makes me realise that even a mere 2 weeks head start makes all the difference when starting to learn a new language. While others really struggle with the new notation, I feel as if everything makes so much more sense.

And another first for this week: site visits. First off the rank was <a href="https://www.fjordnet.com/offices/melbourne/">Fjord</a>, an Accenture division that specialises in everything digital. The main part of talks and presentations was geared towards the UI/UX students - although I learned that I could easily call myself a business designer, service designer or customer journey designer with all my experience as a business analyst.  Their Liquid Studio was of interest for us developers, but at the same time we were told that being a full stack engineer was not enough to succeed - ideally a new recruit has also experience in mechatronics or Unity certification. And there's only 8 people working in Australia, divided over 2 offices. So probably not the right choice for me - but an interesting visit nonetheless.
