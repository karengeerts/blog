I've been doing a couple of coding challenges these past few weeks, and I notice a few patters I'd like to share with you:
<!--more-->

<ul>
 	<li>it's very hard not to just complete the challenge first thing. As in: bash away on the keyboard until your code does what they want it to do. So I always give myself some opportunity to do just this (otherwise I'll feel restless the rest of the day, thinking 'will I be able to ever make this work?').</li>
 	<li>it's not very hard to make the code work. I guess it's a matter of applying for jobs at a correct level, but I can deliver whatever the code challenge requires me to deliver.</li>
 	<li>coding challenge are not about making the code do, what they asked it to do (well, maybe a bit). It's like attaching a resume to your application and thinking "well it's there, it has all the bits in it a resume needs and I put RESUME on top of the document so surely this is a winning resume".</li>
 	<li>coding challenges are about showing off EVERYTHING you can bring to the table as a developer, such as:
<ul>
 	<li>reading requirements. Do you need to post your repo to Github? Zip and email? Put it on a usb stick and hand deliver? Ignoring simple instructions leads to a simple "no thank you"</li>
 	<li>reading requirements. Does your code do absolutely everything they asked for? How sure are you?</li>
 	<li>reading requirements. Did you add any additional features while they specifically asked you not to?</li>
 	<li>explaining yourself through your code. This is where it doesn't not pay off to be super clever with your code if it takes someone else 10 minutes to understand what is happening. Keep it simple, use names that make sense, try and write a story with your code.</li>
 	<li>adding tests to help you to tell that story. Use meaningful subjects and contexts to explain the behaviour you intended to happen.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
And for those of you submitting code in Ruby, one of the most useful snippets of knowledge I've come across in a long time: <strong>rubocop -aÂ </strong>makes rubocop run in autofix mode (so you don't have to manually change all those indentations...)
