I'm absolutely delighted with the team I have worked with for the last week. They're newish as a team themselves - a lot of people have been working at REA for a few years, but moved into the team recently. And there's also another woman who's completely new to REA, but with more coding experience.

My strengths in this first week?
<ul>
 	<li>naming things. Exactly because I'm now and I don't know a lot about the domain we're working in, I need to know precisely what I'm dealing with. So "segment" for me is a bit of a vague name for a variable: is it a time_segment, or a cost_segment, or a payment_segment or all of the above (segment_hash)?</li>
 	<li>understanding when to refactor and when to go with the flow. Almost every single piece of code I've come across, could be refactored to improve readability and maintenance. But sometimes there's only enough time to make it work (especially when factoring in the time I need to get my head around all these new concepts). So for now I'm mostly happy to go with the flow, and I'm hoping a chance to refactor will present itself in the not so far away future.</li>
 	<li>asking for a time-out (and a lot of other things). This probably is the thing I will struggle with most - asking others to interrupt their train of thought, to allow me to jump on board and fully understand what's being discussed. I am fully aware that nobody expects me to completely know all of the +30 microservices and their ins and outs, but when the team tries to size the upcoming work, I prefer to have at least a vague idea of the tasks involved.</li>
</ul>
It's been a very intensive week, and every day I've gone home shattered, it takes a lot of energy to be learning this much! Luckily for me REA also takes time to celebrate successes (e.g. fortnightly Friday night drinks) and the tribe and squad do loads of social activities as well. This weekend I scouted the cycle route I could take to work (a 40 min ride from Thornbury), which I really should start doing if the current amount of morning/afternoon teas and birthday cakes is anything to go by.
