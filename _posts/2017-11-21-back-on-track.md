I arrived back in Melbourne late last night. The 25 degrees Celsius difference in maximum daily temperature combined with a 10 hour time difference proves a less than ideal recipe for doing some in-depth learning. That's why I've decided to do some of the career outcomes prep work (which I'm required to do for General Assembly's WDI boot camp) today.
<!--more-->

The prep work includes having an updated resume (easy: I already had one), a LinkedIn profile (idem) but then the list gets harder: find 10 job descriptions of jobs I would qualify for at the end of the course, find 3 sectors I'd want to work in and list some of the companies in these sectors. I'm assuming this should all be Melbourne based (as I have no immediate plans to move), which makes it quite hard.

I also need to find 5 portfolios of web development practitioners I admire - I have never looked at the online portfolio of a single web development practitioner, so this is a hard nut to crack. I'll have to rely heavily on my old friend Dr. Google!

Speaking of which, I already found one blog post I think might come in handy in the very near future: <a href="https://medium.com/coderbyte/a-guide-to-becoming-a-full-stack-developer-in-2017-5c3c08a1600c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Guide to Becoming a Full Stack Developer in 2017</a>. I haven't read it fully yet, but I did see a link to a page that describes how to work with the DOM - something I wanted to revisit before the start of the boot camp next week.
