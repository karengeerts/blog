If this song gets stuck in your head for the rest of the day, don't blame me - blame Ruby!

The past 2 weeks were pretty full-on; we covered a lot of topics in the boot camp: connecting to a third party using RESTful API's, creating a database in PostgreSQL, designing an ORM and implementing it using Active Record, and probably some other topics I can't remember now. I also built my second project, one where we could focus on the back-end rather than the front-end (and it shows):Â https://arcane-river-12389.herokuapp.com/

I came across the Rijksmuseum's API and got really excited about its functionality, before realising it has been broken since early December. I'm keeping my fingers crossed they'll fix it before the end of the boot camp so I have something slightly more impressive to show. And it will be a good incentive to do something about the quite shocking styling it currently has.

After spending a considerable amount of after-hours effort on this project, I continued spending time with Ruby, since I had signed up for a <a href="http://railsgirls.com/melbourne.html">Ruby Girls Melbourne</a> event. On Friday evening I was invited to the install party (champagne included) and on Saturday I worked my way through a Toyrobot Code Challenge, together with another Ruby Girl. It was quite challenging since she had no experience whatsoever in Ruby, and neither of us had ever written a test in RSpec.

But as they say, the greater the challenge, the greater the triumph! At the end of the day we managed to test all of the desired methods and get beautiful green test results. I'm pretty sure we didn't write the most elegant Ruby code, but the aim of the day was getting an introduction to TDD and that has been certainly achieved - and I absolutely love it! Must be my background as a business analyst, where I had to keep banging on about requirements all the time. Now I can rewrite these as tests and use them to guide my development.
