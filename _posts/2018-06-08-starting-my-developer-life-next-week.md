This morning I signed the contract so I guess it's now safe to announce that I'll be starting as a developer next week with <a href="https://www.rea-group.com/IRM/content/default.aspx">REA</a> - the company behind <a href="https://www.realestate.com.au/rent">Realestate.com.au</a>, which is probably the website that I used most when planning the move from Wellington to Melbourne.

I'm absolutely over the moon, because I'll get to work with Ruby in a company that really walks the walk when it comes to inclusion and diversity. And maybe also because they have in-house baristas?

My project for next week is to export this blog from a paid hosting provider to a free one - seeing as I don't have any business critical content to host and I'd like to avoid hosting costs for the blog and the portfolio site when the plan renews in a few months. I want to look into Github pages and let Microsoft pick up the bill for hosting the few MB's worth of images and code.
