Today was the first day of boot camp. We have a total of 23 students, about as many women as men, and from different age groups. I'm definitely not the youngest but also not the oldest, just average :)

We spent a lot of time playing around in the terminal (usingÂ <a href="https://www.iterm2.com">iTerm2</a> instead of the inbuilt one). For text editors it was ok to stick with <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a> which I had been using before. Not that I'm an expert, but there are a few settings I tweaked and would hate to do again in Sublime.

Most useful thing I learned today was how to create a bash_aliases file (although it took me a while to realise I had to restart the terminal session in order to make it all work as expected).

We also looked at how to <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/">master markdown</a> which will probably be useful soon if I want to make my github page look less as if it was created by a 5-year-old. I played around with the different options in a private gist - haven't reached the master level just yet.

All in all a good day, happy to having been able to keep up with the pace (bar a minor incident where I wanted to install <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> and the computer said no - you don't have permissions). Luckily we have some stellar teaching aids who helped me out in no time.
