As it's nearly the end of the year, the end of my probation period (yay!) and nearly exactly 1 year ago since I ever laid my eyes on Ruby code, I'd like to do my own personal retro of the last year.

## What went great:

* I actually already knew I had the best husband in the universe, but this last year made it even more clear. He kept supporting me morally, financially, mentally and even by doing code reviews. He made the struggle a lot easier by providing support where possible.
* I finished General Assembly's bootcamp! Sounds easy and sounds like a given, but it isn't. I've heard from others about drop-outs in their class, and I also had people dropping out halfway through. So patting myself on the back for finishing the 12-week programme.
* I got a pretty sweet job without having to wait for *too* long. It felt like a long time, especially for having been without income for 5 months prior to graduating. I've resigned from jobs before, but I've never experienced the job search as a developer, which made it scarier than what I was used to.
* 6 months into the new job I feel as I'm finally grasping *some* of the concepts I'm supposed to be familiar with. I also feel I know now enough of the basics to be able to find what I don't know.
* Mentoring. They're really great at providing mentoring for those who want/need it at REA. I have more than one mentor, which helps me in understanding some concepts (everyone has their own approach of explaining).
* Exercises. Lately I haven't spent as much time as I'd like to on websites such as [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/users/karengeerts), but I really enjoy them. It gives me the sense of progression and achievement that is sometimes lacking at work (where the learning curve is a lot steeper than learning *just* Ruby).
* Opportunities. Melbourne is a great city to live in, but even more so for (aspiring) web developers. There's more Meetups than I can attend and opportunity tickets to conferences I could not have attended otherwise (thx Pycon and RubyConf). I went to YOW! a few weeks ago and was surprised at how many familiar faces there were in the crowd.

## What could have been better:

I think I can summarize all of these bullet points as "hard truths about being a career changer", although some of them might be more true for me than for others in similar circumstances.

* Knowing how to ask for help. This really is quite tricky, especially for those who are not used to it. I am used to understanding concepts quickly - and when I don't, I know how to achieve the necessary understanding on my own (read an article, a book, watch a video, etc).
Not understanding something after getting an explanation 10 times, reading 20 Stack Overflow questions (and a million answers) and watching 30 videos is completely novel to me. So I coped badly with it: I kept going and going at it (thinking I would find The Solution by just reading more, watching more). When I then asked somebody for help, I would be so frustrated with myself, the other person thought I was super angry with them for not having everything spelled out for me to begin with.
* Asking for help. Knowing what exactly I need help with is not easy. At work, before we can start working on a card (and actually type in some code), we need to clone the repo from Github, create a branch, authenticate with AWS, build and run a Docker container, run Rake tasks,... before writing a single line of code. It has taken me months to figure out what the process was, why the process was there and how to follow all steps in the process. Most of the time I had no idea what I was doing, so I had no clue how to start asking questions that would lead to more insight.
* Asking for help that fits my needs. Nobody in my team knows my level of understanding of any given concept - and I only know my own level of understanding when I know nothing about the subject. So it can be quite time consuming to ask a question, but also to formulate an answer building on the concepts I'm already familiar with.
* Pair programming. At work we're really strong on pair programming, and there's a belief that the best way to learn is through pair programming. I disagree. I think a lot can be learnt through pair programming, but not everything. I also believe that there needs to be some equality in order for pair programming to work, even more so when the pair is junior-senior. I found it really hard combining typing code in the code editor, running commands in the terminal and trying to take notes of what I was doing. I was completely exhausted after an hour or 2 - but pairing is for the whole day, so I had another 4 to go after lunch breaks.
Let me be clear: I'm not against pair programming (otherwise I'd better resign), I strongly believe it requires a lot more preparation and communication than coding solo.

## Actions for next year:

* Drop the perfectionism. It makes me feel stressed and unhappy and everyone around me as well. It's ok to feel dead tired if your brain has had to deal with new information all day long (look at how much toddlers get to sleep!). It's ok not to attend all of the Meetups, read all of the tweets, the articles, the books, and do all of the online courses. Try to walk before trying to run. Try to run before trying to cycle. Try to cycle before trying to ski. (I'll stop there, but the point is that it will never be enough. There's always more to learn, or achieve a better understanding of something you're already quite familiar with).
* Embrace the basics. Don't try to understand all of the exotic commands in Git, but understand how to deal with common situations and know where to get help for the uncommon ones. Repeat, repeat and repeat all of the "basic stuff" so you can do them in your sleep (and it won't tax your brain at all). This will give you more brain power to deal with the actual task at hand.
* Choose the context. In the context of my team, I am by far the most inexperienced one. In the context of people having graduated from bootcamp in April this year, I might be better at "doing stuff" in AWS. Compared to most of them, my React skills might be lacking.
And compared to most people dreaming of changing careers, I'm living the dream!
