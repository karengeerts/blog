At the start of the week we had an alumna come in to talk about her experiences in her current role as a developer with <a href="https://envato.com/">Envato</a>. It was a very honest and informative talk, but the thing I remember most was her statement that she ended up in tears in class, at 3pm on the first day of group project week. The day of her talk was that exact same day for us...

Some of us did end up in tears (some in class, some somewhere more private). I'm happy to report I didn't, but it was an extremely difficult, frustrating and demanding week. Group projects are always hard, but when nobody is really confident in what they're doing, discussions quickly end up in blaming others for "ruining MY code" and saying things like "YOUR database doesn't work". My main problem was being in a group of 3, it would always be 2 against 1. Add some gender and age dynamics into the mix, combined with a language divide ("JavaScript versus Ruby stuff"), and you end up with a recipe for dynamic conversations.

I really learned a lot last week, not only about how to run and rerun migrations, seed databased, use the flash hash and do impressive things with UUID's to create url's, but also about team dynamics, standing up for myself when needed and letting go when appropriate.

The result of our hard work can be found here and on <a href="https://github.com/karengeerts/worm">Github</a>. We'll receive more feedback next week - at the moment the code is very much in a state of "just get the thing to work". I also have a few ideas of how to improve the current website - especially the voter's webpage could be made to look a whole lot better on mobile screens.

Which brings me to the fact that after all of the group work stress, the "finding a job" stress is getting to me more and more. All of the recruiters tell us to have a perfect Github profile with the most amazing hobby projects to show prospective hiring managers, as a way to showcase our passion and eagerness to self-learn. We also need a perfect cv as well as the best cover letter of all the other candidates. And we need to realise we're competing against the 19 other students of our boot camp, as well as all the other graduates and self-taught coders.

As a result I find it super stressful to decide what to spend my time on: should I be looking for jobs? Perfecting that cv? Spending another hour to improve a cover letter that seems to become only worse after every edit? Look into CI and containers? Deep dive into another JS framework or improve my TDD skills?

Probably best just to take my bike out for a little ride and clear my head. Or contemplate about the last project in 3 weeks' time and see if there is something bike related idea I can come up with.
