One of the models I've come across over and over again in my previous career as a consultant is the <a href="https://www.businessballs.com/freepdfmaterials/fisher-transition-curve-2012bb.pdf">Process of Transition model by John Fisher</a>.

It is a model about personal change, and the different stages a person goesÂ  though before reaching the end of their personal journey. Depending on the person and the type of change, the result can either be denial, disillusionment, hostility, complacency or moving forward. That makes 4 negative outcomes and 1 desired outcome (the moving forward, and continuation of the change journey).

I like this model a lot because it clearly shows that even on the happy path of moving forward, one needs to traverse the so-called "valley of despair" (with its stages of fear, threat, guilt and depression) before achieving their goal.

Last week felt a lot like the valley of despair - the headache I got on Tuesday didn't disappear until today (Sunday), and it feels as if it only takes longer and longer to grasp new concepts. My brain feels extremely full at the moment, while at the same time I understand more and more about how little I actually know.

Which actually is a nice little segue into the <a href="https://twitter.com/gdcfpday">Global Diversity CFP</a> Day workshop I attended yesterday. I attended without any idea of what I could speak about, but thanks to the mentors and the instructional videos, I came away with a catchy title and a nearly finished abstract to start submitting to Meetups and conferences. I'll keep you posted on how that's going (so you will find out eventually what that catchy title is).
