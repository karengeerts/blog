Last week wasn't any less busy than the week before. I had to make sure that every line of code of my final project was tested in time for the meet and greet event, and to celebrate everything was working I decided to upgrade my terminal shell. Of course that meant that at the evening itself my rails app no longer worked locally, since I had switched from bash to zsh, and the app could no longer find the environment variables.

Luckily the Google gods were with me, and I had it all fixed before the first guests arrived. Unfortunately for me none of the people I spoke with had a suitable job on offer, but I enjoyed the opportunity to catch up with my former class mates and see how they were doing in their job search.

A few of them already had found jobs, but the majority was still looking. Front end wizards and visual designers are more in demand than back end wonder women it seems, but I have a few promising leads.

I'll be visiting family in the next 3 weeks so I don't expect to spend a lot of time job searching / coding / blogging. Probably not a bad idea to rediscover life without a laptop again - wonderful things happen in it.
