It's been 2 weeks since my last post and I have now graduated from boot camp. On the final day every student received a nickname, and mine was Gem Queen - since I had built a Ruby gem for the presentation.

At first I was really disappointed that I hadn't delivered anything remotely to do with having a chat bot telling me where the nearest station was and what time my train was leaving. It became clear pretty quickly during project week that that goal was not achievable in just 4 days, due to constraints posed by the PTV API (that didn't do anything with options passed in to the methods) and my own knowledge of how to do a lot of things.

Realising this, I narrowed my focus to delivering some kick ass back end code, fully tested, and building a Ruby gem. I succeeded, was happy to have graduated, and then got busy with getting ready for the big job search and attending Meetups in Melbourne, <a href="https://rubyconf.org.au/2018">RubyConf</a> in Sydney and travelling back to attend a DevOps Girls workshop.

That all left me with precious little time to finish my project - I really wanted to add some front end to show off the functionality. Deploying it to Heroku was a bit more challenging than anticipated (I learned how to deal with environment variables and had to hardcode a lookup table to prevent Heroku from timing out), but I got there in the end. Have a read <a href="https://github.com/karengeerts/gmooh/blob/master/README.md">here</a> and click on the image to try it out for yourself. (I know it looks a bit weird on your laptop, but the idea is to use this site on the go and so I optimised it for mobile. And yes, I know that can be done in a better way, but there's already a long list of things I want to improve!)
