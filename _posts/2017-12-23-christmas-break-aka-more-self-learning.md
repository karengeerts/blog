Yesterday we finished week 4 of the boot camp and now we can enjoy 2 weeks without going to class, but I'm planning on doing at least as much coding and learning. Probably with a more flexible schedule (I also plan on doing a lot of celebrating, relaxing and enjoying down time), but I'd like to keep the momentum going.
<!--more-->

In week 4 we got to play around with Ruby, <a href="https://github.com/pry/pry/wiki">Pry</a> and did some exercises with the <a href="http://sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a> framework. One of them was to display current weather information, based on parameters passed as string queries in the url. That reminded me of one of the FreeCodeCamp <a href="https://codepen.io/karengeerts/pen/qjpQjY">projects</a> I did a few months back on Codepen.  I tried to run it on my local computer, but when I did, the lay-out looked super messy (probably because I didn't link to the correct Bootstrap libraries and I need to have all the icons installed locally. Which makes it another activity I can add to my to do list for the break.

Probably not a bad thing to list the things I aim to do the following days - I intentionally want to make this list as ambitious as possible, with a wide variety of difficulty levels. I anticipate some days when I might have a headache, or I might prefer outdoor activities over sitting indoors staring at a screen. That's why I also include some reading material and videos.

<strong>Aspirational to do list:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Add functionality to the Tic Tac Toe game we completed in class as a project. Add visual style elements, sound effects (which I will mute anyway because I don't like them) and the option to create a bigger grid.</li>
 	<li>Build a new game: hangman. This is mainly for sentimental reasons. I had to build a hangman game in Borland Delphi for an exam in my Business Informatics degree. My result was 17/20, but I felt I had absolutely no idea what I was doing. I'd like to have another go at it without the "help" of the IDE.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
 	<li>Play around with HTML and CSS so that I have a better understanding of the different building blocks in HTML (such as semantic tags) and know how to improve my personal website.</li>
 	<li>Improve my personal website. I want to improve on the current design and add more content to it, to make it look more as an interactive resume - without overdoing it!</li>
 	<li>Change my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/karengeerts/">LinkedIn profile</a>. It's actually one of the things we're supposed to do as part of the Outcomes stream of the boot camp; I need to make it look more as if I'm a web dev looking for a job than the business analyst with a hobby.</li>
 	<li>Read the books I've lent from the library (about HTML/CSS, Ruby and jQuery).</li>
 	<li>Continue with the <a href="https://www.wa4e.com/lessons">web applications for everybody</a> course.</li>
 	<li>Keep practising vanilla JS, Ruby and Python by doing challenges on <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com">Hackerrank</a> - and maybe start taking some of the other tutorials</li>
 	<li>Speaking of tutorials: I bought a full year subscription to <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/">CodeSchool</a> when I was doing FreeCodeCamp and I got frustrated with all the JavaScript challenges - I'd better go back and see if they've updated materials and/or there are other things of interest. They have a few projects now too that I might look into, which I could then use to...</li>
 	<li>Improve my Github profile. I've never spent any time pinning repositories, so all of my tiny practise repos now take up most of my profile landing page, which is definitely not a good look.</li>
</ul>
Is that list aspirational enough? I surely hope so! One thing I forgot to add was finishing the homework we were assigned yesterday around 5.15 pm. Oh yes:  we had a false fire alarm at 4 pm, and instead of leaving like every normal person would do, our class decided we really had to understand a Ruby exercise before we could enjoy our holidays. We didn't leave early, no: we had class until 5.45 pm.

Happy holidays everyone!
