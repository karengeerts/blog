As mentioned in the previous post, I also had to do some pre course work in order to help me land a job at the end of the boot camp. One of the tasks was to register a domain (which was very easy and cheap through <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/">namecheap</a>. My husband asked me if I was planning on hosting this blog on that domain, which I actually wasn't. His question triggered my curiosity though, so I googled around to find a decent web hosting company that offers options to showcase a portfolio of projects in more than one language.

<a href="https://www.hostgator.com/">Hostgator</a> seemed to have everything I needed, even on its cheapest (hatchling) plan. It then took me a while to figure out how to point from namecheap to hostgator - turned out a Very Important email had ended up in the spam folder.

After getting all that sorted, I created a subdomain with Hostgator - which took me much longer than needed to due to some inconsistencies in the menu options with Hostgator. Once I created the blog.karengeerts.me subdomain, it was relatively easy to export and import my existing WordPress website to Hostgator, although I did loose all of my theme settings and ended up with a very white and bland looking page.

I have now remedied the blandness by applying a standard WordPress theme, which is more than enough for now. My ambition is not to become a WordPress guru - I'm using it as an easy way to blog. I'll need all the time I can get to build websites from scratch during the boot camp and don't want to waste it on fine tuning the colour scheme of this blog.
