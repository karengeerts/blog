Had some tough weeks - lots of new things to digest, and not enough time to do it. We flew through NodeJS, Express and React, but never took our time to fully explore its possibilities. I'll add it to the list of things I'll do when the boot camp ends, which is this week!

I'm happy that it will soon be over, because I'd like to spend more times looking into the things that I found interesting, instead of discussing things that I don't find valuable. This is not meant as criticism of the teachers or the curriculum, it's just a fact of life that each of us has a different background and different interests.

So after 2 weeks of being taken on a rollercoaster, I was pretty stoked to be able to spend some time exploring a possible fourth and final project.

My <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Hairy_Audacious_Goal">Big Hairy Audacious Goal</a> is to build a chat bot that can tell me what my nearest public transport stop is, and when what route departs from there. The more achievable goal (by the end of the week) is to build a web app that does the same, but specifically for train stations.

I spent a lot of time during the weekend getting to grips with the <a href="https://timetableapi.ptv.vic.gov.au/swagger/ui/index">PTV API</a>, and I truly lovedÂ  finding my way around it, in combination with a <a href="https://github.com/dshaw1/ruby-ptv-api">ruby gem</a> that someone developed in January (speaking of just in time delivery).

Today I spent again most of my time trying to link results table to each other (so I can show a route name instead of an id) - it's not going as fast as I would hope, but I have tonnes of fun doing it, which for me is slightly more important (for now)!
