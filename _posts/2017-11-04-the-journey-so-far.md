As mentioned in my previous post, I've actually studied a Computer Science related degree at university. The <a href="http://staging.vub.ac.be/en/study/business-and-technology/programme/r/master-of-science-in-business-engineering-business-and-technology" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Master of Science in Business Engineering: Business and Technology</a> taught at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel is the current version of that degree.

In the years after I also took a few Computer Science paper at the <a href="https://www.ou.nl/">Open Universiteit</a>, so I can confidently say I have a basic understanding of core CS concepts.

Throughout those studies I had to complete programming assignments in <strong>Borland Delphi </strong>and <strong>Java</strong> - and I never learned to like programming. Instructions were poor and help hard to find. This all happened at a time when <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stack Overflow</a> didn't even exist yet!

Fast forward to the current year (2017). Sometime in June I stumbled across <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org">Free Code Camp</a> (FCC) - a completely free and open source learning platform that offers tutorials to introduce students to <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong> and <strong>JavaScript</strong>. I was really happy with how quickly I learned the skills to build a decent website (that very first one can be admired <a href="https://codepen.io/karengeerts/full/WORgvQ/">here</a>). The farther I got with FCC, the more frustrated I grew with the algorithm puzzles I had to solve in JavaScript.

I then discovered <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/">Code School</a> and took the JavaScript Road Trip courses (highly recommended - not free though). I tried going back to the FCC exercises, but I just couldn't muster any enthusiasm to spend hours on end trying to find which semi colon I had forgotten to put where.

So I went searching for a thorough introduction to programming in general. I really hit the jackpot with Dr Chuck's Coursera course <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/python">Programming for Everybody (Getting started with Python)</a>. He also maintains his own website where he offers all of the material for free, which makes it even easier for me to highly recommend this course (and the follow-up ones).

I was so excited about everything <strong>Python</strong> I signed up for a workshop with <a href="https://djangogirls.org/melbourne/">Django Girls Melbourne</a> which came with the added bonus of free entry to PyCon AU 2017! Since attending the conference I've been trying to attend the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/PyLadies-Melbourne/">PyLadies </a>Meetups as often as I can (which has only been once until now...).

Besides Python, I also spent a lot of time with <strong>Ruby, </strong>since it's in high demand in Melbourne. I did the free tutorial at <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-ruby">CodeAcademy</a>, but felt I had hardly scratched the surface of the possibilities. I went to the library and discovered they had a grand total of 2 books on Ruby in their possession. I'm currently somewhere halfway in <a href="http://headfirstruby.com/">Head First Ruby</a>, a book I can also highly recommend.

After getting this far, I realised I'm lacking a clear sense of direction as well as the energy to learn completely new concepts after a full day's work in the office. Having talked things through with my husband, I decided to apply for General Assembly's <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/education/web-development-immersive">Web Development Immersive boot camp</a> - and I got the confirmation yesterday I have been accepted!

Between now and the start of the boot camp I'll spend a few weeks in Belgium with family - so I will only have limited time to update this blog. I've also been sent the mandatory pre-course work that I need to make time for (they estimate it will take 40-60 hours to finish, here's to hoping my FCC experience will already pay off).
