I'm trying to migrate my Hostgator hosted website and blog to Github pages and thought Jekyll would be a good idea. This is still very much a work in progress and will require a few more hours in a weekends between now and October (which is when I believe I should renew my hosting subscription).

It's an interesting exercise in which nothing is as straightforward as I'd hope it would be. An incompability of gem versions requires me to upload everything straight to the interwebs before I can see what the result looks like - so don't be surprised if you come across some weird looking stuff in the next couple of weeks!
