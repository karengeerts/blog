Nearly half a year since my last post, and a little over a year since starting my life as a developer. A lot of things have happened in that time, so let's catch up:

I decided to leave REA and joined Zendesk last month.

It was a difficult decision to leave, but in the end I realised I did not get the support I needed to deliver what was expected from me. 

I will never forget the absolutely fantastic people helped me along the way and I hope I can stay in touch with these amazing human beings. They taught me about coding, about DevOps, about how to time your proposals for maximum impact and how to pick your battles - with people as well as with code. They also taught me the importance about staying positive while under pressure and how team members can inspire each other to achieving amazing things.

Like all things in life that don't work out the way I had hoped, I try to learn from the experience in order to avoid the same thing happening ever again. 

Having been at Zendesk little over a month, I realise that I'm still very much in the honeymoon phase in my new role, but I'm a lot happier for a number of reasons - and it's not just the free snacks or the shorter commute.

The team I'm in is still relatively new (and has doubled in size with me and someone else joining at the same time), which means there's a lot less of doing things a certain way because that way worked perfectly 4 years ago. It also means everyone needs to adjust: the "old team" simply can't continue to work how they used to work (because us newbies need to be brought on board).
