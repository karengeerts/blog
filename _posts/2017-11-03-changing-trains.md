Today is my last day as a business analyst. Maybe not forever, definitely for a few months. Later this month I will be doing a web development immersive boot camp at General Assembly.

I've always had an interest in technology - I'm even of those people MY AGE who can claim they started coding age 7. Studied a technology degree at university even, I never landed a job creating software. Adjusting some HTML code and writing tiny XML scripts are the most technical things I have done in my professional career.

My career until now has mainly been about studying people, process and technology - and devising ways how they could be changed to increase efficiency. Although it's still something I'm really passionate about, I've grown more and more excited about the prospect of changing trains on my career path. I'd like to be able to create and build things, solve puzzles, collaborate with people over the globe and contribute to the open source community.

This blog is meant to keep myself accountable for my progress - I will share the goals I set myself, the books I read, the tutorials I take, other learning materials I come across,... and my achievements (no matter how small).
